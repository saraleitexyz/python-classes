# A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dictionary. However,
# to avoid confusion, let’s call it a glossary.
# - Think of five programming words you’ve learned about in the
#   previous chapters. Use these words as the keys in your
#   glossary, and store their meanings as values.
# - Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output.
#   You might print the word followed by a colon and then its
#   meaning, or print the word on one line and then print its
#   meaning indented on a second line. Use the newline character
#   (\n) to insert a blank line between each word-meaning pair in
#   your output.
