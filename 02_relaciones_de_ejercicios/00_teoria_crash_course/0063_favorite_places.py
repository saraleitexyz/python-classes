# Favorite Places: Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three names
# to use as keys in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places for each person. To
# make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends to name a few of their
# favorite places. Loop through the dictionary, and print each person’s name and their
# favorite places.
